I have submitted this as this was my intentional submission.

The plan was to expand upon what is now the final submission but to set the text of the TextArea in the window to display the console results.

I also worked on a visual version which was an extension of a Tic Tac Toe game I looked at but was unable to work out how/where to apply the logic to the GridLayout in time. (It does make for an interesting if not rather large version of Tic Tac Toe however.)

I have only been learning programming in an academic capacity from this, my second Semester, which began in February. I am learning more skills each day, attending sessions based in Java and C++, and further application of Java through Android Studio.
